# ⚔️ betterValheim – BickyBurger Edition ⚔️

Skål, raider.

This is the unofficial modpack setup used by players on the **BickyBurger Valheim server**.  
To us, it’s a convenient place to stash everything we use: mods, configs, install instructions, and tweaks.  
To you, it’s a finely curated experience, nicely bundled together.  
If you're not part of the server, you're still welcome to poke around and borrow whatever you like.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

A curated pile of mods and custom configs designed to:

- Expand Valheim’s mechanics without turning it into a completely different game
- Improve QoL (yes, auto-stack and better chests are in)
- Bring some challenge back into late-game progression
- Add flavor, humor, and some extra "WTF" moments

We keep all relevant mod DLLs, config files, and notes in this repo to make setup easier across machines.

## 🛠️ BickyMods

You can find the full collection of external Bicky-mod DLLs [`here`](BickyBurgerServerMods).  
This list is updated as new mods are added or removed from the server.

---

## 🌐 External mods

[`here`](ExternalMods) are all the mods that we found are fine additions to betterValheim.  
(Most of them should run fine, but always test compatibility)

---

## 🧾 Configs

All mod and server config files can be found [`here`](configs).
Use them to match the official BickyBurger server setup, or as a base for your own tweaks.

## ⚙️ How to Install This Modpack (Manually)

### 💡 1. Install betterValheim

1. follow the installation guide in `/betterValheim-x.x.x/README.md`.

### 🧩 1. Install desired external mods

1. Open Thunderstore Mod Manager.
2. Create a new Valheim profile (or duplicate your current one for safety).
3. Download this repo (either clone or [📥 download ZIP](https://github.com/unicorncodez/betterValheim/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)).
4. Inside the mod manager, go to `Settings > Browse Profile Folder`.
5. Copy the contents of the repo’s `/ExternalMods` folder into `BepInEx/plugins`.

### ⚙️ 2. Use the Custom Configs (Optional but Recommended)

1. Still in your profile folder, open `BepInEx/config`.
2. Copy over the `.cfg` files from `/config` in this repo.
3. Overwrite if prompted (but make backups first if you're tweaking things!).

This step ensures all gameplay settings, difficulty scaling, and mod behavior match the BickyBurger setup😎.
